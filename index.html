                <h2>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>Kebbi State has a very rich historical background both in relation to the Hausa State and the Sokoto Caliphate. Both the emergence of Sokoto Caliphate, most of the area comprising Kebbi State was dominated by the powerful Kingdom of Kebbi carved out of the old Songhai Empire by the legendary warrior Muhammadu Kotal Kanta. Other areas are the Yauri Kingdom and the Zuru confederation. Following, the Fulani jihad and the establishment of Sokoto Caliphate in the early part of 19 century, the area became the south-western part of the caliphate under the famous scholar and warrior, Sheik Abdullhi Danfodio, the brother of leader of the caliphate, Sheik Usmanu Danfodio. As a result of the colonial conquest of the Sokoto Caliphate in 1893, the area became part of the protectorate of northern Nigeria. After Nigeria’s independence in 1960 and following the state creation, the area was first, part of the North-western state (1967-1976), Sokoto state (1976-1991) and with Birnin Kebbi as the State, created on 27th August 1991 with Birnin Kebbi as the state capital. It currently has twenty-one local Government Areas          </main>

                <h2>GEOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>Kebbi State is located on the north western part of Nigeria between latitudes 10¬0 and 130N and longitudes 3030’ and 60E. It has a total landmass of about 37,699 square kilometers out of which 36.46% is made up of farmland. However, about one third of the state is situated in desert prone environment thus making it one of the front-line states for the menace of drought and desertification. The state shares an extensive border with Niger Republic to the North and Benin Republic to the west with many inter-cultural and ethnic linkages. It is internally bordered to the North-East by Sokoto State to the East by Zafara State and to the south by Niger State. The landscape of Kebbi State is dominated by extensive flood plains (Fadama) of the inland river valley systems. The Niger River flows southwest across part of the state and the Rima River flows southerly through the center of the state to join the Niger. Both rivers have broad flood plains. The flow of River Rima is, however, perennial which reaches its peak during the short wet season that last between June and September. The largest sources of surface water, however, is in Yauri and Ngaski Local Government Areas where the River Niger forms large body of water several square kilometers in size known as Kainji Lake; which is 80% located in Kebbi State. The geology of Kebbi State is characterized by thick and vast sequences of sedimentary deposits of the Sokoto Rima-basin, which underline about 50% of the area. The rest being underlain by Precambrian Basement complex rocks. The predominant soil type in Kebbi State, however, is the ferrugirious tropical soils. Their main features include a sandy surface horizon underlain by weakly developed clayey, mottled and sometimes concreting subsoil. Although, they are generally considered to be high in natural quality, they are very sensitive to erosion because ones the vegetation cover is removed, the sandy topsoil are easily washed away by rain water and wind. The soil show low water holding capacity and are therefore susceptible to drought. Another type of soil that occurs in the state is the alluvial or fadama soil mostly found in Rima and Niger River Valleys. This soil is suitable for crop production. Farming in Kebbi State indeed depends to some extent on the fadama land that are sometimes several kilometers in width. In terms of rainfall, however, the mean annual in the state varies significantly from the northern part (733mm) to the southern area (1045mm). Total number of rain days also varies from the north to the south (50 days to 80 days respectively). The wet season starts from June to September in the northern parts and April to October in the southern parts, with a characteristic intense local thunderstorm wither a short period.

                <h2>COMMERCE</h2>
                <p>After agriculture, commerce is the largest employer of able bodies’ workforce in the state. Commerce is however, mostly dominated by distributive trade in manufactured goods and textiles although there is some level of activity in primary products. With an estimated poverty level of 72% the purchasing power of the citizenry is low. Consequently there is absence of large scale distributors and most of the supermarkets buy finished goods in Sokoto from major distributors for resale in the State.
